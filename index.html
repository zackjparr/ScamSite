                What are you gonna do about it? That's what I thought. Now get back in your car and drive to the nearest Fazoli's and rethink your life choices. I mean you believed that they would
                make a new Shrek movie? C'mon. Speaking of Fazoli's, how good is their breadsticks. Pretty good right? Why would you even go to Olive Garden? Anyways, yeah, sorry about the mess.
